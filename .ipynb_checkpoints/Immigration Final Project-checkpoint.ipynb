    "    -howandwheregreencard.xls\n",
    "    Assume refugee applicants for 2017 are roughly the same as 2015 and the applicants are distributed iid Uniformly over the year.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. With Refugees, where do they come from? What country brings the highest proportion of refugees vs Green Card holders? Do these countries have more refugees than others on average?\n",
    "    -howandwheregreencard.xls\n",
    "    Plot on map with concentric circles showing number of immigrants and proportion of immigrants that are refugees.\n",
    "    \n",
